Has this ever happened to you?

_scrolling through 4 tabs of the undergraduate bulletin while getting locked out of solar trying to use the course planner_

Unfortunately, this is an issue that's plagued me and my teammates for far too long. 

What if it was possible to go through all these required courses and plan out your degree without the hassle of using so many different tabs and platforms? What if you could plan out your degree without even opening the undergraduate bulletin? In fact, what if you could plan out your degree while in a groupchat with your friends so they could give you tips and advice?

Introducing Stonybot. A discord bot utilizing our custom undergraduate bulletin library, which can pull titles, course codes, descriptions, prerequisites, and credits from the bulletin on request.

You are able to list all the courses in a department, search through specific courses, or even just flip through random courses should you get bored.

However, what use would viewing courses do without being able to track if and when you want to take them?

That's where our built in course tracker comes in. It uses your discord IDs to store your courses. Because it uses discord IDs, it can be private and restricted to you by discord authentification, or it can be shown to your friends at your choosing. In addition, the planner is accessible across every server the bot is in, meaning you are not stuck to a planning on just one server!
