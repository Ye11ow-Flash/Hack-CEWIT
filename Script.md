Has this ever happened to you?

_scrolling through 4 tabs of the undergraduate bulletin while getting locked out of solar trying to use the course planner_

Unfortunately, this is an issue that's plagued me and my teammates for far too long. 

What if it was possible to go through all these required courses and plan out your degree without the hassle of using so many different tabs and platforms? What if you could plan out your degree without even opening the undergraduate bulletin? In fact, what if you could plan out your degree while in a groupchat with your friends so they could give you tips and advice?
